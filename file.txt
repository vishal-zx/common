Cloud Services for Modernization

Default (GPT-3.5)

Scenario:

A global supplier is looking to modernize its order processing system. Among other things, this system includes Accounts Payable, Accounts Receivable, Inventory, Shipping, Invoicing, and Raw Materials modules. Most of their current system is built on a mainframe stack which is several versions behind in terms of system upgrades and patches, and, while the modules used by the company are provided with out-of-the-box implementations by the mainframe vendor, the company has chosen to heavily customize those modules over multiple years. Internal users interface with the modules of the system using "green screen" terminals. There is a thin web layer for presentation to and utilization by external users which submits Message Queueing (MQ) calls to the mainframe for the back-end business logic. The supplier wants to migrate from their Data Center to the Cloud due to the potential in cost savings and the opportunity to enhance and expand their business and its profitability.

Discuss and research with your group:

What types of Cloud services (either from the previously discussed list or others) would you recommend using for this modernization effort?

For modernizing the order processing system of the global supplier and migrating it to the cloud, several types of cloud services can be recommended. Here are some key recommendations:

Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS):

Utilize IaaS offerings such as Amazon Web Services (AWS) EC2, Microsoft Azure Virtual Machines, or Google Compute Engine for hosting virtual servers. This can help replicate the mainframe's computing power in the cloud.
Platform as a Service (PaaS):

Consider using PaaS services like AWS Elastic Beanstalk, Azure App Service, or Google App Engine for deploying and managing the web layer and thin web applications. These services simplify the deployment and scaling of web applications.
Container Orchestration:

Implement containerization using Kubernetes or AWS EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service) to manage and orchestrate containers for the various modules. This allows for efficient scaling and management of application components.
Database as a Service (DBaaS):

Use DBaaS offerings like AWS RDS, Azure SQL Database, or Google Cloud SQL for managing databases in a scalable and cost-effective manner. This can be crucial for modules like Accounts Payable and Accounts Receivable.
Serverless Computing:

Consider serverless computing options like AWS Lambda, Azure Functions, or Google Cloud Functions for handling specific tasks or functions within the modules. This can help reduce operational overhead.
Message Queueing as a Service:

Leverage cloud-based message queuing services like AWS SQS, Azure Service Bus, or Google Cloud Pub/Sub for the communication between the web layer and mainframe back-end. This is essential for ensuring smooth interaction.
Identity and Access Management (IAM):

Implement robust IAM solutions provided by the cloud providers to secure access to resources and data. This is especially important for maintaining security and compliance.
Data Storage and Backup:

Utilize cloud-based storage services like AWS S3, Azure Blob Storage, or Google Cloud Storage for storing data, backups, and archives. Implement data redundancy and backup strategies for critical data.
Analytics and Monitoring:

Use cloud-native analytics and monitoring tools like AWS CloudWatch, Azure Monitor, or Google Cloud Monitoring to gain insights into system performance, troubleshoot issues, and optimize resource usage.
Migration Services:

Employ cloud migration services provided by the chosen cloud provider to efficiently move existing mainframe workloads and data to the cloud while minimizing downtime.
DevOps Tools:

Implement DevOps practices and utilize cloud-native DevOps tools to automate deployments, updates, and scaling. Tools like AWS CodePipeline, Azure DevOps, or Google Cloud Build can be valuable.
Cost Management and Optimization:

Use cloud cost management tools and best practices to monitor and optimize cloud spending, ensuring that cost savings are realized over time.
Compliance and Security Services:

Leverage cloud-native security and compliance services to meet regulatory requirements and enhance the overall security posture of the system.
Training and Skill Development:

Invest in training and skill development for the IT team to effectively manage and operate cloud-based services and solutions.
It's essential for the global supplier to carefully plan and execute the migration to the cloud, considering factors like data migration, application refactoring, security, scalability, and cost control. Additionally, a well-defined roadmap and project management approach should be established to ensure a successful modernization effort.
